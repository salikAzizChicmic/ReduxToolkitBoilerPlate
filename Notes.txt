1) Create a Redux store with configureStore

configureStore accepts a reducer function as a named argument
configureStore automatically sets up the store with good default settings

2) Provide the Redux store to the React application components

Put a React-Redux <Provider> component around your <App />
Pass the Redux store as <Provider store={store}>

3) Create a Redux "slice" reducer with createSlice

Call createSlice with a string name, an initial state, and named reducer functions
Reducer functions may "mutate" the state using Immer
Export the generated slice reducer and action creators

4) Use the React-Redux useSelector/useDispatch hooks in React components

Read data from the store with the useSelector hook
Get the dispatch function with the useDispatch hook, and dispatch actions as needed
